## 🔧 Implementation Considerations

### API Rate Limits & Quotas
- **HubSpot:** 100 requests/10 seconds (Professional/Enterprise)
- **Salesforce:** Varies by license (typically 5,000-100,000+ calls/day)
- **Stripe:** No published limits (designed for high volume)
- **Google Analytics:** 1,000 requests/day (free), more with paid plans
- **Databox:** 1,000 API calls/day (free tier)
- **Firebase:** Generous free tier, pay-as-you-scale model

### Authentication Methods
- **OAuth 2.0:** HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Analytics, Firebase
- **API Keys:** HubSpot (legacy), Databox
- **JWT/Custom:** Stripe (API keys), Firebase (service accounts)

### Webhook Support
- **Full Webhook Support:** Stripe, HubSpot, Salesforce
- **Limited Webhooks:** Firebase (database triggers)
- **No Native Webhooks:** Google Analytics (use Measurement Protocol), Databox

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For All Services
1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all credentials
3. **Implement proper error handling** and logging
4. **Set up monitoring and alerting** for API failures
5. **Use HTTPS only** for all API communications

### Service-Specific Security
- **Stripe:** Verify webhook signatures, use publishable keys for frontend
- **HubSpot/Salesforce:** Use OAuth 2.0 instead of API keys for new integrations
- **Firebase:** Use security rules, implement proper authentication
- **Analytics:** Anonymize PII, respect user privacy preferences
