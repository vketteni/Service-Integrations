  Firebase      Stripe API    Email
```

## Getting Started

2. **Review the primer** for authentication and basic setup
3. **Implement core functionality** using the provided code examples
4. **Add complementary services** as needed for your workflow
5. **Set up monitoring and error handling** following best practices

## Contributing

Each primer focuses on practical developer integration needs. If you find gaps or have suggestions for improvements, contributions are welcome.

## Security Considerations

All primers emphasize security best practices:
- Proper API key management (see [API Key Management primer](./api-key-management/primer.md) for comprehensive guide)
- OAuth 2.0 implementation (see [OAuth 2.0 primer](./oauth/primer.md) for comprehensive guide)
- Webhook signature verification (see [Webhook Signature Verification primer](./webhook-signature-verification/primer.md) for comprehensive guide)
- Rate limiting and error handling (see [Rate Limiting & Error Handling primer](./rate-limiting-error-handling/primer.md) for comprehensive guide)
- Data privacy and compliance considerations (see [Data Privacy & Compliance primer](./data-privacy-compliance-considerations/primer.md) for comprehensive guide)

Remember to always use test/sandbox environments during development and never commit secrets to version control.
