## 🔄 Common Integration Patterns

### Synchronous Integration Patterns
- **Request-Response** - Direct API calls with immediate response
- **Aggregation** - Combining data from multiple services
- **Orchestration** - Central coordinator managing service calls
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Sequential processing through multiple services

### Asynchronous Integration Patterns
- **Event-Driven** - Services communicate through events
- **Publish-Subscribe** - Decoupled message distribution
- **Message Queues** - Reliable asynchronous communication
- **Event Sourcing** - State changes stored as events

### Data Integration Patterns
- **Data Synchronization** - Keeping data consistent across services
- **CDC (Change Data Capture)** - Capturing and replicating data changes
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** - Separate read/write models
- **Event Store** - Persistent event stream storage

## 🛡️ Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```javascript
// Protects against cascading failures
const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(apiCall, {
  threshold: 5,        // failures before opening
  timeout: 60000,      // time to wait before retry
  resetTimeout: 30000  // time before attempting reset
});
```

### Retry Pattern with Exponential Backoff
```javascript
// Handles transient failures gracefully
const retryWithBackoff = async (operation, maxRetries = 3) => {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      await delay(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000); // exponential backoff
    }
  }
};
```

### Bulkhead Pattern
```javascript
// Isolates critical resources
const criticalPool = new ConnectionPool({ max: 5 });
const nonCriticalPool = new ConnectionPool({ max: 10 });

// Use different pools for different operations
const criticalOperation = () => criticalPool.acquire();
const nonCriticalOperation = () => nonCriticalPool.acquire();
```
